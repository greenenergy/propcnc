The idea is to use one cog per motor, so for a reprap that is 4 cogs (x,y,z,
extruder).

One cog can be the G-Code interpreter

One cog can drive a display (multi-line lcd or vga)

--------------------

The X/Y coordinates seem to be in millimeters, and the build area is 20 cm x 20
cm, which is 200mm by 200mm. 

I can use an 8.8 Fixed Point system for tracking all the coordinates

One motor can run at full speed, and the other will run slower. The interpreter
can determine how slow the slow motor needs to go to make a straight line.

One problem I'd like to deal with is that we are dealing with physical devices,
so taking acceleration/deceleration into account could be important. Apparently
it helps in accuracy.

Also - one fellow was talking about what happens at corners. When the printer
heads to a corner, then wants to change direction, there is some deceleration
and then acceleration, so the amount of material involved will change unless the
extruder is slowed down to take this into account. And you must take into
account the spring constant of the plastic, so that when you tell the extruder
to slow down, you tell it soon enough so that the plastic doesn't just run on by
itself. All of these changes are pretty small, but necessary for a high quality
build.

Pin Usage:

P0-P5: LCD Display

The motors will use 3 pins, x = data pin, x+1 = shift pin, x+2 = output pin
DS: data pin
SHCP: shift pin
STCP: output pin


P6-P8: Motor 1  
P9-P11: Motor 2
P12-P14: Motor 3
P15-P17: Motor 4

P28: SCL - I2C Serial clock pin
P29: SDA - I2C Serial data pin
P30: TX - USB
P31: RX - USB
